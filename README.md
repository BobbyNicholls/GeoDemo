## Basic outline

## Changelog

## Things I would do if I had more time / this was not a demo
 - AWS CodePipeline to version control my lambda functions and other code, also to do CI/CD
 - Use poetry manage package versioning to ensure compatibility
 - Dockerise / containerise my deployments, integrate with poetry
 - Move from trunk development to having an intermediary 'dev' / 'development' branch, maybe even 'uat' if needed.
 - Integrate with backend databases and S3 buckets
